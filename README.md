Automated Coffee maachine!

We created a website that can control a raspberry pi servo. 

The continued work on this project would be to build out the website add logic for setting alarms and create a more resiliant servo system for button presses. 

To deploy install from requirements.txt on a raspberry pi and run: 

*sudo python otto-control.py*

Then on the same local network navigate to the ip address of your pi. 
If you hit ip/forward the servo will rotate clockwise and ip/backwards the servo will rotate counterclockwise.
